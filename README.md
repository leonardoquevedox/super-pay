# SuperPay.js

<!-- [![N|Solid](https://cldup.com/dTxpPi9lDf.thumb.png)](https://nodesource.com/products/nsolid) -->

SuperPay.js is a multi-gateway brazillian payment solution, similiar to PHP's Omnipay.

# Main Features:
  - Common syntax between gateways
  - Abstraction of complex gateway concepts
  - Straight to the point payment flow
  - Vanilla JS made (with love ‚ù§)

# Why?

The integration process with payment gateways can be quite tricky, specially if you never worked with them before. 
We strongly believe that payment shouldn't be such a hard to work to implement.
Since it is interesting for payment gateways to keep complex and specific structures of integration in order to tie you up to their services, we've deviced to change the game!

### Stack

SuperPay.js uses a number of open source projects (and hopefully will power many more):

* [Axios] - HTTP requests should **always** be this easy!
* [Node.js] - JavaScript powered servers!

And of course SuperPay.js itself is open source with a [public repository][dill] on GitHub.

### Installation

SuperPay.js requires [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) v8+ to run.

### Roadmap:
